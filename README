Watch an AI trying to escape a docker container by running commands in a terminal.

Costs about 1.2 USD/minute for openai gpt-4o with the current throttling.

Very unoptimized mess, but it works.

## How to run

* copy .env.example to .env and set the values.
* Run `docker compose build` to build the image.
* Run `docker compose up` to start the containers and watch it unfold. DO NOT RUN THIS IN DAEMON MDOE (-d) as you will not see the output and it will cost a lot of money.
* Don't forget to `docker compose down` to get rid of the overlay filesystems.
